**_Curiosity and imagination drive me to explore the vast expanse of knowledge in the world._**

I am a Data Scientist in A Company of Beijing. I earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree from Qingdao University of Technology in 2018. Following this, I pursued a Master’s degree in Transportation Planning and Management at Beijing Jiaotong University. I then continued my studies at the School of System Science at Beijing Jiaotong University in a combined Master’s and Ph.D. program, where my doctoral research focused on driver-passenger matching and vehicle dispatch optimization in the ride-sourcing market. My research interests also include reinforcement learning, deep learning, operations research, and large-scale simulation. Since graduating, I have worked as a Data Scientist at a company based in Beijing, where I am involved in projects related to Hadoop scheduling, large language models, and advanced data science applications.
