**_Curiosity and imagination drive me to explore the vast expanse of knowledge in the world._**

I am a Data Scientist at a Beijing-based company, with a strong academic and research background in data science and transportation systems. I earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree from Qingdao University of Technology in 2018. Subsequently, I pursued a Master‚Äôs degree in Transportation Planning and Management at Beijing Jiaotong University. Building on this foundation, I enrolled in a combined Master‚Äôs and Ph.D. program at the School of System Science at Beijing Jiaotong University, where my doctoral research focused on optimizing driver-passenger matching and vehicle dispatch in the ride-sourcing market.

My broader research interests span reinforcement learning, deep learning, operations research, and large-scale simulation. Since completing my Ph.D., I have been applying my expertise as a Data Scientist, working on projects involving Hadoop scheduling, large language models, applied operation research and cutting-edge data science applications.
