## 0. Abstract

Many cities around the world have introduced dockless micromobility services and witnessed their rapid growth. Shared dockless electric scooters can expand transportation options for underserved neighborhoods and populations, but they may also exacerbate existing transportation inequalities. So far, our understanding of the equity impact of dockless electric scooter services is limited. To address this research gap, this study developed an analytical framework that compares the equity performance of dockless electric scooter and docked bicycle sharing systems in Washington D.C., using a range of measures including availability, accessibility, usage, and idle time. The results show that dockless electric scooter services increase the accessibility of shared micromobility options in disadvantaged neighborhoods, but they also intensify travel disparities between neighborhoods. Compared to shared bicycles, shared electric scooters provide a higher level of spatial accessibility overall due to a larger supply; however, the greater supply of shared electric scooters primarily leads to longer average idle times rather than more trips. Finally, it appears that bicycle sharing systems' equity programs are more effective than those offered by electric scooter operators in promoting usage in low-income neighborhoods. These findings suggest that simply increasing vehicle supply may not lead to higher micromobility usage in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Instead, policymakers should combine various strategies, such as promoting registration in equity programs and reducing barriers to micromobility service use (e.g., smartphone and banking requirements).

## 1. Research Background


In recent years, shared micromobility services such as bike-sharing and dockless electric scooter sharing have experienced rapid growth. Bike-sharing systems include both docked and dockless options, while all shared electric scooter systems are dockless. Shared micromobility is particularly effective for short-distance travel, expanding transportation choices for many people. However, due to various barriers such as lack of spatial access, affordability, lack of digital literacy to access micromobility services, or the absence of a bank account, smartphone, or data plan, underserved and vulnerable groups are often excluded from the widespread benefits of these services. Understanding the equity of micromobility services is crucial for transportation planners and policymakers to bridge these service gaps for underserved populations. Due to the emergent nature of shared electric scooter services, their equity impacts have not been thoroughly studied. On the other hand, as shared electric scooter services are often operated by profit-oriented private entities, operators might be less focused on promoting equity. Electric scooter travel tends to be more expensive than bike-sharing, potentially excluding some travelers from using electric scooters. However, empirical evidence on these equity issues is still limited.

This paper aims to investigate the following questions:

+ Do dockless electric scooter programs provide equal service across different communities?
+ Compared to docked bike-sharing, do shared electric scooter services exhibit more equity?

To evaluate the equity performance of dockless electric scooters and docked bike-sharing systems, an analytical framework was constructed, covering various indicators including **availability**, **accessibility**, **usage**, and **idle time**. Particularly, comparisons were made between these two systems in communities with different socio-economic characteristics. Given the relative immaturity and smaller scale of dockless bike-sharing systems, they were not included in this study.

The study selected Washington D.C. as the research area, which has a docked bike-sharing system (Capital Bikeshare) with over 5,000 bicycles and more than 600 stations, and since 2019, over 10,000 shared electric scooters have been allowed to operate on the city streets. The study period was the summer of 2019.

## 2. Analysis framework and method

Figure 1 describes the research framework of this article. Firstly, the supply of micromobility services in different areas is assessed by examining indicators of availability and accessibility. Availability is defined as the number of micromobility vehicles available for use within a geographic unit; census block groups are chosen as the geographic units for analysis. Three indicators are used to measure the availability of micromobility services:

+ Average daily available vehicles per block group.
+ Average daily available vehicles per resident.
+ Average daily available vehicles per resident + job: Adding residents and jobs together takes into account that visitors such as commuters are also users of micromobility. The number of jobs in an area can be seen as a rough indicator of the economic and social activity heat of the area, which attracts visitors.

Accessibility measures the number of micromobility vehicles that can be reached from a block group. In the article, the method of kernel density estimation is used to calculate accessibility. The higher the kernel density estimation value, the higher the level of accessibility. The specific calculation method involves fitting a smooth surface curve over the location of each bike station or electric scooter. The value of the surface curve is highest at the center of the station/scooter and gradually decreases as the distance from the core increases. The kernel density value eventually drops to zero when the distance reaches a predetermined search radius. A search radius of one-sixth of a mile is used for bike-sharing stations, and one-eighth of a mile for electric scooters. This distance is considered the threshold distance for using these micromobility modes. After obtaining the kernel density estimation values, they are further integrated into the block group level by taking their averages.

Overall, accessibility is a supply measure with more theoretical basis than availability, but availability is easier to explain to the general public. Additionally, availability is more directly related to micromobility regulations, which involve minimum or maximum fleet sizes within specific areas.

Secondly, the article also assesses micromobility services from a demand perspective, using three indicators: number of trips, number of trips per resident, and number of trips per resident plus jobs. Furthermore, idle time is studied, which is the interval between the end of one trip and the start of the next for a vehicle.

To analyze the spatial equity of micromobility systems, the article examines variations in the above indicators across different block groups. Block groups are classified based on their Equity Emphasis Area (EEA) status, income level, and racial and ethnic composition as divided by the 5-year estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2019. Additionally, block groups are categorized by quartiles of median household income. Finally, based on ACS data, block groups are divided into racial and ethnic majority categories, defining a block group as an "X majority" where over 50% of the residents identify with a single race or ethnicity. Block groups where no single race or ethnicity represents over 50% of the population are categorized as "no majority".


## 3. Data
The data used in the article mainly consists of three types: shared scooter data, docked bike-share data, and socio-demographic and employment data.

## 3.1 Shared Electric Scooter Data
The data for electric scooters in June and July 2019 was collected in the General Bike Share Feed Specification (GBFS) format via real-time public APIs provided by each operator. The availability and accessibility indicators for electric scooters were calculated based on data at 6:00 AM on the first day of service provision by each electric scooter operator. Further, trips for electric scooters were inferred from the data of four operators: Spin, Lime, Bird, and Lyft (data from other operators like Helbiz could not be used to infer trips). This dataset includes two types of trip records. The first type encompasses a total of 31,570 Lime and Spin trips, including the start date and time, end date and time, duration, distance, start and end locations, and vehicle ID. The second type includes a total of 216,127 start points and 213,913 end points for Bird and Lyft. For the latter, trips were inferred except for unconnected data points of trip starts and ends.

## 3.2 Docked Bike-Share Data
Bike-share trip data can be downloaded from the Capital Bikeshare website, and availability data can be obtained from real-time public APIs. Each trip record includes duration, start date and time, end date and time, start and end stations, bike ID number, and membership type. Only trips with a duration of 3 to 90 minutes were retained, totaling approximately 219,386 trips for analysis.

## 3.3 Socio-Demographic and Employment Data
Demographic and employment data were obtained from the 5-year estimates of the American Community Survey (ACS) 2015-2019 and the 2019 Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) database. The primary analytical unit used in this study is the block group, typically defined as containing 600 to 3000 people. Additionally, employment data for 2019 were collected from the LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics database and aggregated to the block group level.

## 5. Brief Personal Summary
+ The article employs straightforward comparative analysis methods to explore the accessibility and availability of micromobility in different communities, reminiscent of the style found in SR journals.
+ Accessibility and availability in the article are primarily quantified using kernel density estimates, vehicle counts, and other metrics; additionally, quantification is also done from the demand perspective.
+ For those in need of shared bike data from the United States, it can be downloaded from the Capital Bikeshare website.
