## 0. Abstract

Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) services are expected to fundamentally transform urban transportation patterns. Typically, an MoD platform offers both taxi and carpooling services, which poses additional challenges in operating a large-scale real-time MoD system. Previous studies often assume that passengers fully comply with the platform's decisions regarding pricing and vehicle allocation. However, in reality, passengers may choose different modes of travel based on costs and travel experience, potentially conflicting with the results analyzed from a system perspective. This study proposes a new framework, considering pricing fairness and passenger travel choice, for optimizing vehicle-passenger matching on MoD platforms offering both taxi and carpooling services. Six principles are defined to ensure the fairness of carpooling prices, and an efficient optimization problem is formulated for coexisting taxi and carpooling services. Using taxi data from New York City, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method in numerical experiments and compare it with the current state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that our optimization strategy significantly improves service rate and profit without sacrificing service quality.

## 1. Research background

Currently, Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) has become a primary mode of transportation in cities around the world. Specifically, carpooling offers a cost-effective way to travel, but this can also lead to a diminished experience. Therefore, this raises discussions about whether passengers will accept the journeys and costs associated with carpooling (essentially, the passengers' travel preferences). Some studies have found that a joint optimization of pricing and matching is a more promising approach. Others have considered the fairness of pricing schemes, taking into account the shared journey distance and detours based on segment-based or detour-based pricing. However, they have not considered various characteristics during the carpooling process. The fairness discussed in this article refers to **the idea that passengers who endure a higher detour rate or share rides with more passengers should receive greater discounts**.

Based on this, the article focuses on a platform that offers both express and carpooling services, considering fair pricing schemes and passengers' travel choices, to study the vehicle-passenger matching issue.

### 1.1 Research Contributions
The research contributions mentioned in the article are as follows:

+ A MoD framework was designed, optimizing the matching of vehicles and passengers while considering pricing fairness in coexisting ride-hailing and carpooling services.
+ Six principles that a fair pricing method should meet were summarized, and a fair-aware dynamic carpooling pricing method with all the desired properties was proposed.
+ A vehicle-passenger matching problem based on fair pricing was constructed, which takes into account passengers' travel mode choice decisions and is efficiently solved in the form of a linear assignment problem.

## 2. Research Method
### 2.1 Ride-Hailing System Operation Process

In this study, new passengers of the ride-hailing system submit their travel requests, specifying their starting point, destination, and the latest pickup time. The platform checks whether the waiting time of passengers exceeds their maximum waiting time limit, while also processing previously unmatched travel requests. Apart from passengers who cancel their requests due to long waiting times, other passengers will be matched. Unmatched passengers will continue to wait for matching in the next time window. For successfully matched passengers, the platform generates a service menu, offering discounts for carpooling and information about detour times, as well as the costs and expected waiting times for both express and carpooling services. Upon receiving the service menu, passengers will choose services based on their needs. If a passenger opts for the express service, the quoted fare becomes effective immediately; if they choose the carpooling service, it is assumed that the platform will perform a fairness check before confirming the quote.

Furthermore, if passengers are dissatisfied with any of the travel quotes, they can actively reject the offer and exit the system.


### 2.2 Passsenger type

It is assumed that passengers are sensitive to cost and service quality and have different inclinations towards sharing, which are reflected in their utility coefficients. Once the platform provides a clear service menu, passengers will choose the travel mode that maximizes their utility. The utility of passenger $p$ can be quantified through the following formulas:

$$
u_p^h = \beta_p^h - \beta_p^t w_p^h - \beta_p^f f_p^h
$$

$$
u_p^s = \beta_p^s - \beta_p^t (w_p^s+\delta_p) - \beta_p^f f_p^s
$$

$$
u_p^o = \beta_p^o
$$

Here, $\beta_p^h, \beta_p^s, \beta_p^o$ represent the inherent travel quality of express, carpooling, and other travel modes respectively; $\beta_p^t, \beta_p^f$ are utility coefficients used to convert travel time and cost into perceived utility for the passenger; $w_p^h, f_p^h$ indicate the expected waiting time and trip cost if the passenger chooses the express service; and $w_p^s,\delta_p,f_p^s$ represent the waiting time, detour time, and shared trip cost respectively if the passenger opts for carpooling.

To capture the choice behavior of passengers among express, carpooling, and other modes of transportation, a multinomial Logit model is employed. The probability of passenger $p$ choosing travel mode $m$ is given by:

$$
{Pr}_p^m = \frac{\exp(u_p^m)}{\sum_{k∈{\{h,s,o\}}} \exp(u_p^k)}
$$

### 2.3 Vehicles

The study focuses on two types of vehicles: express vehicles and carpooling vehicles. It is assumed that each vehicle follows the platform's instructions, traveling through a series of pick-up and drop-off points, known as a route. Once a vehicle reaches its final destination (i.e., when the last assigned passenger disembarks), it will park nearby to avoid empty driving until it is reassigned to new passengers.

### 2.4 Platform
The platform collects data on travel requests and vehicles and calculates **(a) serving more passengers** and **(b) maximizing profit**. The service menu provided by the platform to passengers includes the selected vehicle and its offered trip information for each potential passenger, such as waiting time, trip cost, and discounts.

+ Travel requests waiting for service are batch-processed regularly within dispatch intervals;
+ The platform implements an insertion algorithm for each passenger-vehicle pairing, calculating optimized driving routes and price tags for each passenger;
  + The insertion method aims to insert new passengers' start and end points into the vehicle's route, greedily minimizing the total driving distance;
+ An optimization model is constructed to determine which express and carpool services are offered to passengers;
+ Based on the choices provided by the platform, passengers make decisions according to their self-perceived utility.

## 3. Optimal Matching of Express and Carpool Services

This section models the matching problem of express and carpool services as an integer linear programming problem and constructs an additional integer programming problem to integrate these two services into a single ILP.

### 3.1 Express Trips

In express trips, each viable passenger-vehicle match is associated with a travel profit, which is the difference between the trip cost and the trip fare. The trip fare $f_h$ for express trips is calculated using UberX's static charging method:

$$
f_p^h = f_0 + f_t t_p + f_d d_p
$$

Here, $f_0, f_t, f_d$ represent the base fee, the per-minute rate, and the per-mile rate, respectively, while $t_p, d_p$ are the travel time and distance of the express trip. Based on this, the paper formulates the optimal express-passenger matching as the following ILP problem:

$$
\max_x \sum_{p} \sum_{v \in V_p} \delta (f_p^h - c_{p,v}^h)x_{p,v}-\gamma(|P|-\sum_{p} \sum_{v \in V_p} x_{p,v})
$$

$$
\sum_{v}x_{p,v} \le 1, \forall p
$$

$$
\sum_{v}x_{p,v} \le 1, \forall v \in V_p
$$

$$
x_{p,v} \in \{0, 1\}
$$

By solving this profit-maximizing linear assignment problem, the system will determine the optimal allocation of passengers to vehicles. The paper refers to this as the HVO model, but currently, this model does not consider passenger choice.

### 3.2 Carpool Trips
(1) Fairness Criteria

The optimization problem for carpool trips can be defined with the same outcome as the HVO model. The main challenge of this problem is to define a policy for each passenger's fare and to update this policy when new passengers join and share the trip. The paper defines the following principles to assess whether pricing is fair to passengers:

+ (P1) Price Ceiling: The cost for each carpooling service user should be significantly lower than their trip fare $f^h_p$ if they were to travel alone in an express vehicle.
+ (P2) Detour Fairness: Passengers with longer detours should receive larger discounts.
+ (P3) Carpooling Benefit: The more passengers share a vehicle, the greater the discount each receives, thereby reducing the cost each has to pay.
+ (P4) Rational Consideration of Passengers Onboard: In a dynamic carpooling environment with frequent changes, the addition of new passengers may alter the vehicle's route. Therefore, the trip fares for passengers already assigned or onboard should be adjusted to ensure they are lower than the initial quote. Otherwise, passengers already in the car might not welcome the addition of new passengers.
+ (P5) Inconvenience Cost for Passengers Onboard: When there are already multiple carpool passengers in the vehicle, they might be less interested in new carpooling proposals, as each new passenger inevitably brings some inconvenience, such as additional boarding and waiting time.
+ (P6) Profit for the Platform: The total fees paid by all passengers must exceed the trip cost.

(2) Discount Function

Based on the above principles, a discount function $\Phi(\cdot)$ that satisfies these principles was designed. Given a multiplicative discount function $\Phi(\cdot)$, the carpool price for each co-rider is:

$$
f^s_p = \Phi_p \cdot \hat{f}^s_p
$$

Here, $\hat{f}^s_p$ is the price before the new passenger joins, and $\Phi_p$ is strictly less than 1. The updated price $f^s_p$ is always lower than the previous price $\hat{f}^s_p$, ensuring that passengers in the car are motivated to allow shared rides. The initial cost for carpool passengers is also calculated using this formula, substituting the express travel cost $f_p^h$ for $\hat{f}^s_p$. Since discounts are typically related to the detour rate of the passenger, the number of co-riders, and the distance of the shared journey, two indices considering these factors were introduced.

First, the detour index $\tau^d_p$ is defined, which is the ratio of the additional detour distance caused by inserting a new passenger to the updated total trip distance after the insertion, expressed as:

$$
\tau^d_p = \frac{d_p^u - d_p^s}{d_p^u}
$$

Here, $d_p^u$ represents the updated trip distance after insertion, and $d_p^s$ is the trip distance before insertion. As each passenger has a maximum detour distance limit, the maximum detour distance is defined as $d_p^{max}=m·d_s$, where $m$ is the maximum detour ratio. Therefore, $\tau^d_p \in [0, \frac{m}{m+1}]$. The larger $\tau^d_p$ is, the longer the detour experienced by passenger $p$.

Additionally, the carpool index $\xi^r_p$ is defined, reflecting the carpool distance and the number of co-riders experienced by passenger $p$. Carpooling consists of several segments, including the pickup or drop-off points of co-riders. Therefore, carpooling can be divided into segments, which are the shared portions of the journey between two points. For each segment $\lambda$, the travel cost $f_{\lambda}^{h}=f_t · t_{\lambda} + f_d · d_{\lambda}$ is calculated. However, if a segment is shared by several co-riders, the cost for that segment is divided by the number of co-riders $k_{\lambda}$, termed as the shared cost $f_{\lambda}^s=f_{\lambda}^h/k_{\lambda}$. A binary parameter $y_{p,\lambda}$ is introduced, which is 1 if passenger $p$ travels through $\lambda$, otherwise 0. It is defined as:

$$
\xi^r_p = 1 - \frac{\sum_{\lambda} f^s_{\lambda} * y_{p,\lambda}}{\sum_{\lambda} f^h_{\lambda} * y_{p,\lambda}}
$$

This serves as the carpool index to measure the variation in the number of co-riders and the distance of shared travel. Clearly, the more the shared portion of the trip and the more participants in carpooling, the larger the value of $\xi^r_p$. It can be further deduced that $\xi^r_p \in [0,\frac{n-1}{n}]$, where $n$ represents the passenger capacity of the vehicle. The lower bound of 0 indicates that passenger $i$ travels alone throughout the journey, while the upper limit shows a maximum of $n$ passengers traveling together from their common starting point to the same destination.

Finally, a discount function $\Phi$ containing two variables $\tau^d_p$ and $\xi^r_p$ is defined. It should possess the following properties:

+ The range of $\Phi_p$ should be between $[\Phi^{min}, \Phi^{max}]$, where $0 < \Phi^{min} < \Phi^{max} < 1$.
+ Both $\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \tau}$ and $\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \xi}$ should be less than 0.
+ Both $\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \tau^2}$ and $\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \xi^2}$ should be greater than 0.

It's important to note that the first property relates to the previously defined principles P1 and P6. The second property ensures that principles P2, P3, and P4 are satisfied, as larger $\tau^d_p$ and $\xi^r_p$ imply more detour, more co-riders, and a longer shared journey. Thus, the $\Phi$ function monotonically decreases as $\tau^d_p$ and $\xi^r_p$ increase. Lastly, the positive second-order partial derivatives indicate that $\Phi$ is a convex function. Compared to a linear function, $\Phi$ decreases more rapidly at the beginning, slowing down as the two independent variables increase. This characteristic ensures that carpoolers are welcomed and benefit more when the vehicle is almost empty. Conversely, passengers joining a nearly full vehicle receive lesser discounts, preventing over-allocation of passengers to the same vehicle, ensuring principle P5 is met.

The paper constructs a specific discount function that satisfies all the aforementioned attributes. An exponential function $y=e^{-x}$ is chosen. By replacing $x$ with the sum of the detour $\tau^d_p$ and carpool $\xi^r_p$ indices, the final formula for the discount rate becomes:

$$
\Phi_p = \exp(-\alpha(\tau^d_p + \xi^r_p)) - b
$$

The discount coefficient $\alpha$ is used to adjust the magnitude of the discount, while the base rate $b$ is set to ensure that if the vehicle is empty, then $b > 0$, and if not, then $b = 0$. This ensures that all carpool passengers benefit, even if they end up traveling alone.

(3) Integer Linear Programming for Carpool Trips

The paper introduces the concept of carpool profit $\pi_{p,\nu}$, defined as the marginal profit generated whenever a new passenger participates, calculated as follows:

$$
\pi_{p,\nu} = \left( \sum_{p \in P} f^s_p - C^s_{P,\nu} \right) - \left( \sum_{p \in \hat{P}} \hat{f}^{s}_p - C^{s}_{\hat{P},\nu} \right)
$$

Here, $P$ represents the set of all assigned passengers, excluding those who have already reached their destination, while $\hat{P}$ represents the same set before the current passenger joined. $C_{\hat{P},\nu}$ and $C_{P,\nu}$ respectively represent the total trip costs of providing service to the sets $\hat{P}$ and $P$. Therefore, the objective function for carpool trips is:

$$
\max_x \sum_p \sum_{\nu \in V_p} \pi_{P, \nu} x_{p,v} - \zeta (|P| - \sum_{p,\nu \in V_p} x_{p,\nu})
$$

By combining formula (15) with (7)–(9), a new ILP formula for carpool trips, termed SVO, is obtained. HVO and SVO can be processed in parallel to determine the options in the service menu, which are then submitted to passengers awaiting final confirmation. Since HVO and SVO are processed separately, they are collectively referred to as the individual strategy.

### 3.3 Integrated Strategy

The two previously proposed integer linear programs (ILPs), HVO and SVO, not only independently determine the most convenient express and carpool trips but also do not consider passengers' travel mode choices. To incorporate passengers' travel mode choices while offering options for express and carpool services, we designed a problem to find the best combination of express and carpool services for each passenger.

Specifically, the probabilities of choosing express or carpool services are calculated, represented as $Pr_{s,h}^{h}$ and $Pr_{s,h}^{s}$, respectively. It is important to note that once the possible express and carpool services are determined, $Pr_{s,h}^{h}$ and $Pr_{s,h}^{s}$ can be directly calculated from formula (4). Therefore, the expected profit for passenger $p$ when offered express service $h$ and carpool service $s$ is:

$$
E(\pi_{p,h,s}) = Pr^h_{s,h} \cdot \delta \cdot (f_{p,h} - c_{p,h}) + Pr^s_{s,h} \cdot \pi_{P,s}
$$

Here, $\pi_{p,s}$ is calculated using formula (14). Based on this, the overall optimization problem can be defined as:

$$
\max_x \sum_{p} \sum_{h \in H} \sum_{s \in S} E(\pi_{p,h,s})x_{p,h,s} - \gamma(|P| - \sum_{p,h \in H, s \in S} x_{p,h,s})
$$

$$
\sum_{s} x_{p,h,s} \leq 1, \forall p
$$

$$
\sum_{p} x_{p,h,s} \leq 1, \forall h \in H
$$

$$
\sum_{p} x_{p,h,s} \leq 1, \forall s \in S
$$

$$
x_{p,h,s} \in \{0, 1\}
$$

To distinguish from the aforementioned individual strategies, the above-defined approach is termed as the Integrated Strategy. Unlike solving express and carpool problems separately, the Integrated Strategy pairs each potential express with each carpool vehicle and calculates the corresponding express-carpool probability pairs. Ultimately, a pair of express-carpool vehicles, along with other trip information, is determined and presented to the customer.

The above problem is a three-dimensional or three-index assignment problem, generally considered to be NP-complete. Unlike the linear assignment problem, there is no guarantee of an efficient solution for this type of allocation problem. In the paper, sections 5.3 and the appendix demonstrate that the specific formulation of this model can be relatively quickly solved.


## 4. Experimental Section
The experiments designed two case studies: (a) a large-scale New York scenario; (b) a network of limited size, the latter used for sensitivity analysis experiments.

### 4.1 New York Case

+ New York Taxi Dataset
  + Experiment Time: Evening rush hour, two hours;
  + Data Processing: Removal of anomalous data - missing records, trips too short or too long;
  + Final Records: 51,491 data entries;
  + Feature Generation: Maximum waiting time, detour time, time and cost coefficients, and utility coefficients for different modes all drawn from truncated normal distributions. <i>The utility coefficients are based on Habib (2019) and Lavieri and Bhat (2019)</i>. For the platform, only the means are used in the choice model.
  + Trip Feasibility: After trip insertion in the experiments, trip feasibility is checked using the following formula:

  $$
  r_d = r_t + g_r + w + h
  $$

+ Road Network Data

  + Nodes and Segments: 3,671 nodes and 7,674 directed edges;
  + Vehicle Supply: 1,000 express vehicles and 1,000 carpool vehicles;
  + Time Interval: 30 seconds;
  + Other Parameters: Pricing parameters, penalty coefficients, and discount coefficients are based on prior studies.

+ Experimental Scenarios
To compare (a) the two optimization methods proposed in Section 3 and (b) the mature strategies discussed in Section 1.1, the following four scenarios were designed for experimental comparison:

+ S1: Segmentation+Individual. This method segments vehicle routes based on passengers' boarding and alighting nodes. The final cost is the sum of the costs for all segments plus a base fee. HVO and SVO are solved separately to determine the best allocation.
+ S2: mT-Share+Individual. Its basic principle is to distribute the benefits of carpooling between taxi drivers and passengers, without considering the profit of drivers, with all benefits allocated to carpool passengers proportionally.
+ S3: Fairness+Individual. Fairness-aware pricing is based on each user's detour rate and carpooling benefits. As with the above, HVO and SVO are solved separately to determine the best ride-hailing and carpooling vehicle allocation, without considering passengers' mode choice decisions.
+ S4: Fairness+Integrated. Fairness-aware pricing. Unlike separately allocating ride-hailing and carpooling vehicles, the integrated strategy unifies both services in a single ILP, complemented by predicting passengers' travel mode choices.

When adding new passengers to a carpool, the platform checks whether the updated price for those already in the car is lower than their previous price. This incentivizes passengers already onboard to allow others to join. If this criterion is met, the carpool proposal is considered valid. If not, the new passenger is potentially rejected by the existing co-riders, and they passively exit the system.


### 4.2 Grid Network

This smaller network was used to conduct a series of sensitivity analysis experiments to study how different internal (e.g., discount parameters, profit coefficients, fleet size) and external (e.g., population characteristics) parameter choices affect the proposed strategies.

+ Network Size: 16 nodes, 48 segments.
+ Vehicle Scale: 50 express vehicles, 50 four-seater carpool vehicles.
+ Demand Scale: 1,200 passengers.
+ Time Scale: 1 hour, with 30-second intervals.

## 5. Results Discussion

+ The paper compares the market performance under individual and integrated strategies in two scenarios, demonstrating that the integrated strategy can further enhance market benefits.
+ It also compares four other scenarios and discusses the results.

## 6. Future Research

+ Design adaptive and predictive new methods, such as AI-based techniques for predicting passenger travel choices and order cancellation rates.
+ Consider dynamic time forms, integrating matching, pricing, and real-time routing.
+ Combine pricing with idle vehicle dispatch.
+ Consider driver participation in decision-making processes and future supply-demand imbalance scenarios.

## 7. Personal Views on Future Research

- Although the current study considers passengers' personal preferences, these parameters are directly assigned by the authors, which could be further improved in future research.
- Additionally, the complexity of the problem itself, such as considering multi-objective dispatch and temporary vehicle rental in other studies, can be further explored.
- This study is distinctive in considering both carpooling and express services, as well as passengers' personal preferences.
