Due to job search, I recently read some research papers on the topic of "Maritime Traffic Safety," with a focus on operations research optimization methods. Coincidentally, a senior researcher in my laboratory had conducted related research during his postdoctoral period, so I first explored the content of his work. The information about this paper is as follows:

## Abstract
This study addresses the intriguing problem of tugboat scheduling, considering the uncertainty in large container port ship arrivals and tugging process times. The uncertainty in ship arrivals and tugging process times is formulated as a set of discrete scenarios that can be generated from historical port traffic data. The integration of proactive and reactive scheduling strategies to handle uncertainty distinguishes this study from most existing literature. Proactive scheduling strategies account for anticipated variability during the execution of the tugboat fleet schedule, while reactive scheduling strategies adjust the initial schedule appropriately to cope with unexpected scenarios and minimize recovery costs. A mixed-integer linear programming model is established for the proposed tugboat scheduling problem. To handle large-scale problems, a specialized algorithm is designed to generate tugboat chains, enabling efficient resolution of large-scale issues. Finally, extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the practical significance of the model and algorithms developed in this study.

## Research Background
Due to the navigation restrictions in shallow water areas and the immense inertia of ships, vessels often require the assistance of tugboats to move from anchorage to berth. In this process, tugboats need to travel from the berth to the ship's location and then tow the ship to the berth. However, due to the impact of weather conditions and ocean states on ship navigation, the arrival time of ships at the port and the time required for tugboat operations often have significant uncertainty. These factors directly influence the start and end times of tugboat operations. Assigning affected tugboats to other container ships becomes uncertain. Therefore, it is necessary to study the optimization problem of tugboat assignment under scenarios of uncertain ship arrival times and tugboat operation times.


## Research Contributions
The research contributions of the mentioned paper are divided into three aspects:
1. A tugboat scheduling model considering uncertain ship arrival times and tugboat operation times is constructed.
2. To solve the proposed model, both proactive and reactive scheduling strategies are introduced. Proactive scheduling takes into account the expected variability and uncertainty during the scheduling process, while reactive scheduling appropriately adjusts the initial schedule to minimize recovery costs in response to unexpected situations.
3. An effective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is established for the proposed tugboat scheduling problem. The objective is to minimize the total weighted service time and recovery costs of tugboat operations under uncertain conditions. For large instances, a self-organizing algorithm is designed to generate towing chains.

## Research Methods

### Model Construction
The typical workflow of a tugboat is divided into two parts: from anchorage to berth and from berth back to anchorage. In this study, the service network of tugboats consists of an anchorage area, five berths, five two-way port channels, and a tugboat base. Ships travel from deep-water areas to the anchorage area to await tugboat service. For the journey from anchorage to berth, ships can be towed to the berth by several tugboats according to a set schedule, followed by loading and unloading operations. Hours later, the ships are towed back to the anchorage, completing the journey from berth to anchorage. This article focuses more on the journey from anchorage to berth, as once this journey is scheduled, the return journey from berth to anchorage can be considered as a unit operation and arranged separately. This process is represented in the article as shown in Figure 1.

### Deterministic Model (MILP-D)
The authors first constructed a tugboat scheduling model for given ship arrival times without considering uncertainty.

In the model:
+ Objective (minimize total weighted working duration)

  $$
  \min \sum_{g} \sum_{j} \sum_{k} \epsilon_{j} \left( t_{gj}^k + c_{gj}^k - A_j \cdot x_{gj}^k \right)
  $$

  This objective aims to minimize the total weighted working duration of tugboats in the process from anchorage to berth.

+ Constraint 1 (ship allocation constraint)

  $$
  \sum_{g} \sum_{k} x_{gj}^k = 1, \forall j \in J
  $$ 

  This constraint ensures that each ship should be allocated and can only be allocated to one tugboat within the study time range $T$.

+ Constraint 2 (tugboat allocation constraint)

  $$
  \sum_{j} x_{gj}^k = 1, \forall g \in G, \forall k \in K
  $$

  This constraint ensures that each tugboat is assigned to one and only one ship during each time period $k$.

+ Constraint 3 (Tugboat Operation Constraint)

  $$
  \sum_{j} x_{gj}^{k-1} - \sum_{j} x_{gj}^{k} \geq 0,  \forall g \in G,  \forall k \in \{2, \ldots, m\}
  $$ 

  This constraint restricts the tugboat to only start the next work process after completing the previous one. If tugboat $g$ did not serve any ship at time $k-1$, then it cannot provide service at time $k$. In this case, if the tugboat is to provide service, the task at time $k$ is actually the task of the ship at time $k-1$.

+ Constraint 4 (Work Start Time Calculation)
  
  $$
  A_j + M \cdot (x_{gj}^{k} - 1) \leq t_{gj}^{k} \leq A_j + \tau_j, \forall g \in G, \forall j \in J, \forall k \in K
  $$

  This constraint calculates the work start time $t_{gj}^{k}$ of the tugboat. Specifically, when $x_{gj}^{k}$ is 0, the value of $t_{gj}^{k}$ is forced to 0; otherwise, it is between $A_j$ and $A_j + \tau_j$.

+ Constraint 5 (Working Duration Calculation)

  $$
  C_j + M \cdot (x_{gj}^{k} - 1) \leq c_{gj}^{k} \leq C_j + \pi_j,  \forall g \in G, \forall j \in J, \forall k \in K
  $$

  Similarly, this constraint calculates the working duration $c_{gj}^{k}$ of the tugboat. Specifically, when $x_{gj}^{k}$ is 0, the value of $c_{gj}^{k}$ is forced to 0; otherwise, it is between $C_j$ and $C_j + \pi_j$.

+ Constraint 6 (Task Completion Constraint)

  $$
  t_{gj}^k - \sum_{j'} \left( t_{gj'}^{k-1} + c_{gj'}^{k-1} \right) - \Delta C \geq M \cdot \left( x_{gj}^{k} - 1 \right), \forall g \in G, \forall j \in J, \forall k \in \{2, \ldots, m\}
  $$

  This constraint ensures that the tugboat must complete its previous task $j'$ and have a certain idle time $\Delta C$ before serving a newly arrived ship $j$. When $x_{gj}^{k}$ is 0, the right side of the equation becomes a large negative value, making the constraint inactive. This is a 'U-turn' constraint.

+ Constraint 7 (Tugboat Horsepower Constraint)

  $$
  \sum_{g} \sum_{k} (m_g - w_j) \cdot x_{gj}^{k} \geq 0, \forall j \in J
  $$

  This constraint is for ship horsepower limitation. A tugboat $g$ can only serve a ship $j$ if the horsepower of the tugboat exceeds the tonnage of the ship.

+ Constraints 8-10 (Constraints for Decision Variables)
  
  $$
  x_{gj}^{k} \in \{0, 1\}, \forall g \in G, \forall j \in J, \forall k \in K
  $$
  
  $$
  t_{gj}^{k} \geq 0,  \forall g \in G, \forall j \in J, \forall k \in K
  $$
  
  $$
  c_{gj}^{k} \geq 0, \forall g \in G, \forall j \in J, \forall k \in K
  $$

  These constraints define the range for the decision variables.


The above model represents a one-way (anchorage to berth) operation process for tugboats. Additionally, this model is equally effective in a two-way working scenario for tugboats (operations from anchorage to berth and from berth to anchorage) since the time difference between these two processes is usually several hours (average 12 hours in the Port of Singapore). In this case, modifying the input for the set of ships $J$ and the expected arrival time $A_j$ for each ship suffices. Besides this model, the paper also discusses two other scenarios:

1. If the time difference between anchorage to berth and berth to anchorage operations is small, it's not necessary to treat these two processes separately. Accordingly, tugboats can wait at the berth for the ship to load or unload cargo, and once completed, immediately proceed with the next process. In this case, the model can be modified as follows:

$$
min \sum_{g} \sum_{j} \sum_{k} \varepsilon_j \cdot (t_{gj}^k + 2 \cdot c_{gj}^k - A_j \cdot x_{gj}^k)
$$

$$
t_{gj}^k - \sum_{j'} (t_{gj}^{k-1} + 2 \cdot c_{gj}^{k-1}) - \Delta C \geq M \cdot (x_{gj}^k - 1), \forall g \in G, \forall j \in J, \forall k \in \{2, \ldots, m\}
$$

2. If considering the time difference between the two operation processes, but also without the need to treat these processes separately. In this case, tugboats likewise need to wait for the completion of the ship's loading/unloading operations at the berth. Therefore, the authors introduce a loading/unloading operation duration $L_j$ into the model. The total weighted service duration includes $L_j$. Thus, the model can be modified as follows:

$$
min \sum_{g} \sum_{j} \sum_{k} \varepsilon_j \cdot (t_{gj}^k + 2 \cdot c_{gj}^k + L_j \cdot x_{gj}^k - A_j \cdot x_{gj}^k)
$$

$$
t_{gj}^k - \sum_{j} (t_{gj}^{k-1} + 2 \cdot c_{gj}^{k-1} + L_j) - \Delta C \geq M \cdot (x_{gj}^k - 1), \forall g \in G, \forall j \in J, \forall k \in \{2, \ldots, m\}
$$

### Uncertainty Model

Based on historical tugboat service records, the distribution of uncertainty scenarios can be determined, and the probability of event occurrences can be estimated. These records provide valuable information for tugboat scheduling. Therefore, the authors use a set of discrete scenarios to handle the uncertain factors in tugboat scheduling. Given the predicted arrival time of ships $A_j$, a set of discrete scenarios $w_s$, and the probability of each scenario $p(w_s)$, the uncertainty model can be constructed as follows.

+ Objective (minimize the total weighted working duration)

$$
min \sum_{g} \sum_{j} \sum_{k} \varepsilon_j \cdot (t_{gj}^k + c_{gj}^k - A_j \cdot x_{gj}^k) \\ + \sum_{\omega_s} \left\{ p(\omega_s) \cdot \left( \sum_{g} \sum_{j} \sum_{k} \varepsilon_j \cdot \left( t_{gj}^{k+}(\omega_s) - t_{gj}^{k-}(\omega_s) + c_{gj}^{k+}(\omega_s) - c_{gj}^{k-}(\omega_s) - A_j(\omega_s) \cdot x_{gj}^k(\omega_s) \right) \right) \right\}
$$

+ Constraints (basically the same as those in the MILP-D model)

$$
\sum_{g} \sum_{k} x_{gj}^{k}(\omega_s) = 1, \quad \forall j \in J, \forall \omega_s \in W
$$

$$
\sum_{j} x_{gj}^{k}(\omega_s) \leq 1, \quad \forall g \in G, \forall k \in K, \forall \omega_s \in W
$$

$$
\sum_{j} x_{gj}^{k-1}(\omega_s) - \sum_{j} x_{gj}^{k}(\omega_s) \geq 0, \quad \forall g \in G, \forall k \in \{2, \ldots, m\}, \forall \omega_s \in W
$$

$$
A_j(\omega_s) + M \cdot (x_{gj}^{k}(\omega_s) - 1) \leq t_{gj}^{k} + t_{gj}^{k}(\omega_s)^+ - t_{gj}^{k}(\omega_s)^- \leq A_j(\omega_s) + T_j, \\ \forall g \in G, \forall j \in J, \forall k \in K, \forall \omega_s \in W
$$

$$
C_j(\omega_s) + M \cdot (x_{gj}^{k}(\omega_s) - 1) \leq c_{gj}^{k}(\omega_s) + c_{gj}^{k}(\omega_s)^+ - c_{gj}^{k}(\omega_s)^- \leq C_j(\omega_s) + T_j, \\
\forall g \in G, \forall j \in J, \forall k \in K, \forall \omega_s \in W
$$

$$
t_{gj}^{k} + t_{gj}^{k}(\omega_s)^+ - t_{gj}^{k}(\omega_s)^- - \sum_{j} (t_{gj}^{k-1} + t_{gj}^{k-1}(\omega_s)^+ - t_{gj}^{k-1}(\omega_s)^- + c_{gj}^{k-1}(\omega_s)^+ - c_{gj}^{k-1}(\omega_s)^-) - \Delta C \\ \geq M \cdot (x_{gj}^{k}(\omega_s) - 1), \forall g \in G, \forall j \in J, \forall k \in \{2, \ldots, m\}, \forall \omega_s \in W
$$

$$
\sum_{g} \sum_{k} (m_g - w_j) \cdot x_{gj}^{k}(\omega_s) \geq 0, \forall j \in J, \forall \omega_s \in W
$$

$$
x_{gj}^{k}(\omega_s) \in \{0, 1\}, \forall g \in G, \forall j \in J, \forall k \in K, \forall \omega_s \in W
$$

$$
t_{gj}^{k}(\omega_s)^+ + t_{gj}^{k}(\omega_s)^- \geq 0, \quad \forall g \in G, \forall j \in J, \forall k \in K, \forall \omega_s \in W
$$

$$
c_{gj}^{k}(\omega_s)^+ + c_{gj}^{k}(\omega_s)^- \geq 0, \quad \forall g \in G, \forall j \in J, \forall k \in K, \forall \omega_s \in W
$$

## Future Research

1. The paper limits each tugboat to serving only one ship, but in reality, multiple tugboats can serve the same ship simultaneously. Therefore, future research could consider tugboat scheduling in this scenario, also taking into account the heterogeneity of tugboat horsepower, which would make the scheduling quite different from this study.

2. The paper considers the uncertainty of ship arrival times and tugboat working times, but is the number of arriving ships also uncertain? On the other hand, the reason the authors may not have considered this uncertainty is because of the slow speed of maritime transport and the AIS system on ships, allowing ports to know well in advance how many ships are arriving. Hence, there might not be a need to study the uncertainty of the number of arriving ships. This point requires further exploration of how other related studies are conducted.
