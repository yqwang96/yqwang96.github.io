The Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) is a variant of the VRP problem. In this problem, constraints are added for the service time windows of customers. Each customer has a specific time window within which they can accept service. Time windows are typically defined by an earliest start time and a latest end time.

# VRPTW
Compared to the traditional VRP problem, the VRPTW has the following characteristics:
1. Time Window Constraints
   + Each customer has a predefined time window, and vehicles must start service within this window.
   + Vehicles must arrive at or after the start of the time window and start service before the end of the time window.

2. Waiting Time
   + If a vehicle arrives early, it may need to wait until the start of the customer's time window to provide service.

3. Service Time
   + In addition to travel time, the service time at each customer's location must also be considered.

The VRPTW problem can be described as follows:

In the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW), there is a central warehouse, $|K|$ delivery vehicles, and $|N|$ customers requiring service. Each customer has a specific time window $(t_{b}, t_{e})$ within which they must be serviced. This means that delivery vehicles must arrive after the start of each customer's time window and must begin service before the end of the time window. The VRPTW can be modeled as follows:


+ Decision Variables

$$
x_{ijk} = \begin{cases}
    1, \text{ if vehicle } k \text{ travels from node } i \text{ to node } j\\
    0, \text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

+ Auxiliary Variables

$$
u_{ik}: \text{ the order in which vehicle } k \text{ serves customer } j
$$

$$
t_{ik}: \text{ the time at which vehicle } k \text{ starts serving customer } i
$$

+ Objective: Minimize the travel cost of vehicles

$$
min \sum_{k}^K \sum_{i}^N \sum_{j}^N c_{ij}x_{ijk}
$$

+ Constraint: Each customer can only be served by one vehicle

$$
\sum_{k}^K \sum_{i, i \neq j}^{N \cup \{0\}} x_{ijk} = 1, \forall j \in N
$$

+ Constraint: Inflow and Outflow Constraint, vehicles must leave the customer's location after service

$$
\sum_i^N x_{ijk} = \sum_i^N x_{jik}, \forall j \in N, \forall k \in K
$$

+ Depot Constraint: Vehicles must start from the warehouse and eventually return to the depot

$$
\sum_j^N x_{0jk} = 1, \forall k \in K
$$

$$
\sum_i^N x_{i0k} = 1, \forall k \in K
$$

+ Vehicle Capacity Constraint: The demands of customers serviced by a vehicle must not exceed the vehicle's capacity

$$
\sum_i^{N \cup \{0\}} \sum_{j, j \neq i}^{N} d_{i}x_{ijk} \leq q_k, \forall k \in K
$$

+ Constraint on Service Time Windows: Vehicles should provide service within the customer's time window, i.e., the start of service time should be greater than the start time of the service window, and the end of service time should be less than the end time of the service window.

$$
t_{jk} + s_{j} - M \times (1 - \sum_{i}^{N \cup \{0\}} x_{ijk}) \leq b_j
$$

$$
t_{jk} - M \times (1 - \sum_{i}^{N \cup \{0\}} x_{ijk}) \geq a_j
$$

+ Constraint Considering Road Travel Time: If a vehicle consecutively services two customers, then the start time of service for the latter should be greater than the end of service time for the former plus the travel time between them.

$$
t_{jk} \geq (t_{ik} + s_i + t_{ij}) \times x_{ijk}, \forall i \in N, \forall j \in N, \forall k \in K
$$

+ Subtour Elimination Constraint: Avoids sub-tours in the vehicle routing plan.

$$
t_{jk} - t_{ik} + M \times x_{ijk} \leq M -1, \forall i \in N \cup \{0\}, \forall j \in N, \forall k \in K
$$

When I first wrote the model, I formulated the time window constraints as the following two equations, and the result was infeasible. I initially overlooked the case where vehicle $k$ does not serve customer $j$. In this case, these two time window constraints should not be active, but in my formulation, they were effective, and the right side of the equation would be 0, leading to a contradiction in the constraints. Therefore, the model would be infeasible.

$$
t_{jk} + s_j \leq b_j \sum_i^N x_{ijk}, \forall j \in N, \forall k \in K
$$

$$
t_{jk} \geq a_j \sum_{i}^N x_{ijk}, \forall j \in N, \forall k \in K
$$

Additionally, while writing the model, I was also puzzled why, if the time window constraints already ensure that the service for the latter customer will occur after the service for the former, is it still necessary to introduce the subtour elimination constraint?

In reality, if the customers' time windows are quite long, it's still possible for the vehicle routes to loop. Moreover, restricting each customer to only be serviced once also does not avoid the possibility of subtours.


Here's the Python code for solving the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) using Gurobi,
