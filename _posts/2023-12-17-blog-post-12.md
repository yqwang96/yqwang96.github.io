Compared to the traditional VRP, the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) incorporates the limitation of each vehicle's cargo capacity and the demand of each customer. Therefore, CVRP models need to introduce constraints on vehicle capacity.

## CVRP Problem Model

In the CVRP scenario, there is a warehouse and M customers to be serviced. Decision-makers need to plan the routes for K vehicles to meet each customer's demand. The demand of customer $i$ is denoted as $d_i$, and the capacity limit of vehicle $k$ is $q_k$. The mathematical model for this problem can be formulated as follows:

+ Decision variable $x_{ijk}$:
  $$
  x_{kij} = \begin{cases}
    1, \text{ if vehicle } k \text{ travels from segment } i \text{ to } j \\
    0, \text{ otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  $$

+ Objective: Minimize the travel cost of vehicles, where $c_{ij}$ is the travel cost from node $i$ to node $j$

$$
min \sum_{k}^{K} \sum_{i}^{M} \sum_{j}^{M} c_{ij}x_{ijk}
$$

+ Inflow and Outflow Constraint: After servicing a customer, a vehicle must leave the customer's location

$$
\sum_{i}^N x_{ijk} = \sum_{i}^N x_{jik}, \forall k \in K, \forall j \in N
$$

+ Customer Service Constraint: Each customer can only be serviced once

$$
\sum_{k}^K \sum_{i}^N x_{ijk} = 1, \forall j \in N
$$

+ Vehicle Capacity Constraint: The load of the vehicle must not exceed the vehicle's capacity limit

$$
\sum_{i}^{N \cup \{ 0 \}} \sum_{j}^{N} d_{j}x_{ijk} \leq q_k, \forall k \in K
$$

+ Depot Constraint: Vehicles must start from the warehouse and eventually return to the warehouse

$$
\sum_{j}^N x_{0jk} = 1, \forall k \in K
$$

$$
\sum_{i}^N x_{i0k} = 1, \forall k \in K
$$

+ Subtour Elimination Constraint: Using the form of the MTZ constraint

$$
u_{ik} - u_{jk} + M \times (1 - x_{ijk}) \leq M - 1, \forall i \in I, \forall j \in J, \forall k \in K
$$

Compared to the traditional VRP model, this model introduces constraints on vehicle load. If the vehicle load cannot meet the demand of the customers, or if no loading plan can satisfy the demands of all customers, the model is infeasible.

Python code for solving this model using Gurobi is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
import gurobipy as gp
from gurobipy import GRB

# Input parameters
num_customers = 5  # Number of customers
num_vehicles = 2
depot = 0
vehicles_capacity = [9, 10]

# Randomly generate customer locations and demands
np.random.seed(0)
customer_locations = np.random.rand(num_customers, 2)
customer_demands = np.random.randint(low=1, high=5, size=num_customers)

def calculate_distance(loc1, loc2):
    return np.linalg.norm(loc1 - loc2)

dist_matrix = np.zeros((num_customers+1, num_customers+1))
for i in range(num_customers+1):
    for j in range(num_customers+1):
        if i == j:
            dist_matrix[i][j] = 0
        else:  # Default depot coordinates are 0,0
            loc1 = customer_locations[i-1] if i != 0 else np.array([0, 0])
            loc2 = customer_locations[j-1] if j != 0 else np.array([0, 0])
            dist_matrix[i][j] = calculate_distance(loc1, loc2)

# Create model
m = gp.Model('CVRP')

x = m.addVars(num_customers + 1, num_customers + 1, num_vehicles, vtype=GRB.BINARY, name='x')

# Add auxiliary variables: u[i, k] represents the order in which vehicle k visits customer i
u = m.addVars(num_customers + 1, num_vehicles, vtype=GRB.CONTINUOUS, name='u')

# Objective: Minimize total travel distance
m.setObjective(
    gp.quicksum(dist_matrix[i][j] * x[i, j, k] for i in range(num_customers + 1)
                for j in range(num_customers + 1) if i != j for k in range(num_vehicles)), GRB.MINIMIZE
)

# Constraint: Each customer must be served by exactly one vehicle
for j in range(1, num_customers + 1):
    m.addConstr(
        gp.quicksum(x[i, j, k] for k in range(num_vehicles) for i in range(num_customers + 1) if i != j) == 1
    )

# Constraint: Vehicle capacity constraint
for k in range(num_vehicles):
    m.addConstr(gp.quicksum(customer_demands[j - 1] * x[i, j, k]
                            for i in range(num_customers + 1) for j in range(1, num_customers + 1) if i != j)
                <= vehicles_capacity[k], name=f'vehicle capacity constrain {k}'
    )

# Constraint: Vehicles must start from and return to the depot
for k in range(num_vehicles):
    m.addConstr(gp.quicksum(x[depot, j, k] for j in range(1, num_customers + 1)) == 1)
    m.addConstr(gp.quicksum(x[i, depot, k] for i in range(1, num_customers + 1)) == 1)

# Inflow and outflow constraint
for k in range(num_vehicles):
    for j in range(1, num_customers + 1):
        m.addConstr(gp.quicksum(x[i, j, k] for i in range(num_customers + 1) if i != j) ==
                    gp.quicksum(x[j, h, k] for h in range(num_customers + 1) if h != j))

# Subtour elimination constraint
bigM = num_customers + 1
for k in range(num_vehicles):
    for i in range(1, num_customers + 1):
        for j in range(1, num_customers + 1):
            if i != j:
                m.addConstr(u[i, k] - u[j, k] + bigM * x[i, j, k] <= bigM - 1)

# Solve model
m.optimize()

# Print solution
if m.status == GRB.OPTIMAL:
    print('Total travel distance: %g' % m.objVal)
    for k in range(num_vehicles):
        print(f"\nVehicle {k+1}'s route:")
        for i in range(num_customers + 1):
            for j in range(num_customers + 1):
                if x[i, j, k].x > 0.5:
                    print(f" From customer {i} to {j}")
```
