Preface: Recently, I encountered the issue mentioned in the title of this blog at work, and after some testing, I came up with a simple and straightforward solution. I believe this case is actually quite common and will likely come up again in future work, so I wanted to document the problem here. Coincidentally, OpenAI has launched the ChatGPT 4.0 with Canvas model, which is adept at writing blogs and code, so I also wanted to test this model. As a result, this blog was completed with the assistance of GPT-4.0 with Canvas.

When using 🐳 Docker, managing and persisting data is crucial. If you want to map certain 📁 directories from an image to the host machine during the image creation process for easier data management, how can you achieve that? In this blog, I'll guide you on how to synchronize the files from the image to the host machine after building the image, and how to perform persistent mapping.


## 📝 Scenario Description
Suppose you need to create a new Docker image and want certain 📁 directories within the image to be synced with the host machine. For example, you want to define a data directory for your application in the image, `/app/data`, and map it to a directory on the host machine (e.g., `/host/data`) so that during container runtime, this data can be shared in real-time with the host. However, if you try to directly mount the host directory in the Dockerfile, it may lead to the host's empty directory overwriting the container directory, causing data loss. Therefore, we need a more suitable workflow to ensure correct data persistence.

## 🔧 Solution
We can follow these steps to copy data from the image and map it to the host machine.

### 📂 Solution Workflow: Build the Image, Copy Files, and Re-mount
To avoid the empty host directory overwriting data during image creation, we can use the following steps:

1. **📝 Write a Dockerfile and Build the Image**
   First, create a Dockerfile to define your image.
   ```dockerfile
   FROM ubuntu:latest
   RUN mkdir -p /app/data
   COPY . /app
   ```
   In this Dockerfile, we create the `/app/data` directory and copy some application files into the image.

2. **🔨 Build the Image**
   Use the following command to build the image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t myapp-image .
   ```

3. **📦 Create a Container and Copy Files to the Host Machine**
   After building the image, we run a temporary container to copy out the required data.
   ```bash
   docker create --name temp-container myapp-image
   ```
   Use the `docker cp` command to copy the `/app/data` directory from the container to the host machine.
   ```bash
   docker cp temp-container:/app/data /host/data
   ```
   In this way, the data in the image is copied to the `/host/data` directory on the host.

4. **🗑️ Delete the Temporary Container**
   Since we have completed the data copy, we can delete the temporary container.
   ```bash
   docker rm temp-container
   ```

5. **📋 Use Docker Compose to Run the Container and Mount the Volume**
   Now, we can use Docker Compose to define and run the container while mounting the data directory from the host back to the container.
   Create or edit the `docker-compose.yml` file as follows:
   ```yaml
   version: '3'
   services:
     myapp:
       image: myapp-image
       volumes:
         - /host/data:/app/data
       ports:
         - "8080:8080"
   ```
   In this file, we specify `image: myapp-image` and mount the `/host/data` directory to the `/app/data` directory in the container.

6. **🚀 Use Docker Compose to Start the Service**
   Use the following command to start the service:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   In this way, the `/app/data` directory in the container will be shared with the `/host/data` directory on the host, and any changes to that directory will be synchronized without losing the image data.

## 🔍 Summary
When creating a Docker image, directly mapping files to the host machine cannot be done through the Dockerfile alone but by using volume mounting after running the container. This helps achieve data sharing and persistence between the container and the host machine. Specifically:

1. **Prepare the necessary 📁 directories when building the image**: Use a Dockerfile to create data directories and add necessary files.
2. **Copy data using a temporary container**: Use `docker create` and `docker cp` to copy the data from the image to the host.
3. **Mount the host directory when running the container**: Use the `-v` parameter or Docker Compose to achieve file mapping.

By using these methods, you can better manage data persistence and sharing during image creation and container runtime, ensuring that your data can flexibly interact between the container and the host. I hope this article helps you feel more confident in managing Docker data!
