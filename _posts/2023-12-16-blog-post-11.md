The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a classic combinatorial optimization problem, involving the arrangement of a fleet of vehicles to serve a group of customers in the most effective way possible. VRP is of great importance in the fields of logistics, distribution, and transportation planning. There are various modeling methods for VRP, each suitable for different scenarios and constraints. Below are some common VRP models:

## 1. Basic Vehicle Routing Problem Model

### Modeling Approach from "Optimization Modelling, A Practical Approach" and others
In the classic VRP scenario, there is a centralized warehouse, a set of customers to be serviced, and a fleet of vehicles. Vehicles need to deliver goods to each customer in turn and eventually return to the warehouse. There are corresponding travel costs for the vehicle routes to the customers. The objective of the problem is to find the least costly transportation plan that services all customers. Inputs to the model include:
+ Set of vehicles $M$;
+ Set of customers $N$;
+ Cost matrix $C$.

Accordingly, variables can be modeled as follows:

$$
x_{kij} = \begin{cases}
  1, \text{ if vehicle } k \text{ travels from segment } i \text{ to } j \\
  0, \text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

$$
y_{ij} = \begin{cases}
  1, \text{ if there is a vehicle traveling from segment } i \text{ to } j \\
  0, \text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

+ Objective: Minimize the total travel distance or cost of all vehicles

  $$
  minimize Z=\sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{(i,j)}C_{ij}x_{kij}
  $$

+ Constraints:
    + Inflow and Outflow Constraint: Each customer must be served by exactly one vehicle, and the vehicle must leave after serving the customer;

    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^n y_{ij}=1, \quad j=2,3,...,n
    $$

    $$
    \sum_{j=1}^n y_{ij}=1, \quad i=2,3,...,n
    $$

    + Starting and Returning Constraint: All vehicles must start from the depot (warehouse) and eventually return to the depot; i.e., the number of vehicles leaving from the depot should equal $K$, and the number of vehicles returning to the depot should also equal $K$. _In this formula, the index of the depot is 1, and j also starts from 1. This means it includes an arc (1,1)._

    $$
    \sum_{j=1}^n y_{1j}=K
    $$

    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^n y_{i1}=K
    $$

    + Travel Condition Constraint: Each customer must be serviced only once and only by one vehicle;

    $$
    \sum_{k=1}^K x_{kij}=y_{ij},  \forall i, j
    $$

    + Arc Restriction Constraint: To avoid the appearance of sub-tours. The following constraint is the type proposed by Dantzig, Fulkerson, and Johnson (DFJ). However, this type of modeling results in an exponential increase in constraints with the increase in n. The advantage of this constraint is not clear in large-scale scenarios.

    $$
    \sum_{(i,j) \in SÂ·S \\ i \neq j} y_{ij} \leq |S|-1, \text{for all subsets  S of \{2, 3, ..., n\} }
    $$


### Other Modeling Approaches

Similarly, assuming there are M vehicles and N customer demands, without considering customer demand and vehicle capacity constraints. In this scenario, the Classical VRP model is formulated as follows:

  + Sets
    + Set of vehicles $M$
    + Set of nodes $K=\{0, N\}$

  + Decision Variables

  $$
  x_{ijk} = \begin{cases}
    1, \text{ if vehicle } k \text{ travels from segment } i \text{ to } j \\
    0, \text{ otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  $$

  + Objective: Minimize the total travel cost

  $$
  min \sum_{k} \sum_{i} \sum_{j} c_{ij}x_{ijk}
  $$
  
  + Customer Service Constraint: Each customer is visited only once, meaning only one vehicle travels to customer j; the vehicle must leave the customer location after service

  $$
  \sum_{k}^K \sum_{i, i \neq j} ^ N x_{ijk} = 1, \forall j \in N
  $$

  + Depot Constraint: All vehicles must start from and eventually return to the depot;

  $$
  \sum_{j}^N x_{0jk} = 1, \forall k \in K
  $$


  $$
  \sum_{i}^N x_{i0k} = 1, \forall k \in K
  $$

  + Inflow and Outflow Constraint: Vehicles must leave the customer location after visiting

  $$
  \sum_{i}^N x_{ijk} = \sum_{i}^N x_{jik}, \forall k \in K, \forall j \in N
  $$

  + **Subtour Elimination Constraint**: Ensures that each path generated is a continuous route starting from and eventually returning to the depot, rather than several separate loops. A common subtour elimination constraint is the MTZ constraint, as shown below. Where $u_{ik}$ is an auxiliary variable representing the order in which vehicle $k$ visits customer $i$.

  $$
  u_{ik} - u_{jk} + M \times x_{ijk} \leq M - 1, \forall i \in N, \forall j \in N, \forall k \in K
  $$

  
  Python code for solving the above model using Gurobi is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
import gurobipy as gp
from gurobipy import GRB

# Assumed parameters
num_customers = 5  # Number of customers
num_vehicles = 2   # Number of vehicles
depot = 0          # Index of the depot
# Randomly generate customer locations and demands
np.random.seed(0)
customer_locations = np.random.rand(num_customers, 2)

# Calculate distance matrix
def calculate_distance(loc1, loc2):
    return np.linalg.norm(loc1 - loc2)

dist_matrix = np.zeros((num_customers+1, num_customers+1))
for i in range(num_customers+1):
    for j in range(num_customers+1):
        if i == j:
            dist_matrix[i][j] = 0
        else:  # Default depot coordinates are 0,0
            loc1 = customer_locations[i-1] if i != 0 else np.array([0, 0])
            loc2 = customer_locations[j-1] if j != 0 else np.array([0, 0])
            dist_matrix[i][j] = calculate_distance(loc1, loc2)

# Create model
m = gp.Model('VRP')

# Add variables: x[k, i, j] == 1 if vehicle k travels from customer i to j
x = m.addVars(num_customers + 1, num_customers + 1, num_vehicles,
vtype=GRB.BINARY, name='x')

# Add auxiliary variables: u[i, k] represents the order in which vehicle k visits customer i
u = m.addVars(num_customers + 1, num_vehicles, vtype=GRB.CONTINUOUS, name='u')

# Objective: Minimize total travel distance
m.setObjective(gp.quicksum(dist_matrix[i][j] * x[i, j, k] for i in range(num_customers + 1) 
for j in range(num_customers + 1) if i != j for k in range(num_vehicles)), GRB.MINIMIZE)

# Constraint: Each customer must be served by exactly one vehicle
for j in range(1, num_customers + 1):
    m.addConstr(sum(x[i, j, k] for k in range(num_vehicles) 
    for i in range(num_customers + 1) if i != j) == 1)

# Constraint: Vehicles must start from and return to the depot
for k in range(num_vehicles):
m.addConstr(sum(x[depot, j, k] for j in range(1, num_customers + 1)) == 1)
m.addConstr(sum(x[i, depot, k] for i in range(1, num_customers + 1)) == 1)

# Inflow and outflow constraint
for k in range(num_vehicles):
    for j in range(1, num_customers + 1):
        m.addConstr(sum(x[i, j, k] for i in range(num_customers + 1)
        if i != j) == sum(x[j, h, k] for h in range(num_customers + 1)
        if h != j))

# Add subtour elimination constraint
bigM = num_customers + 1
for k in range(num_vehicles):
    for i in range(1, num_customers + 1):
        for j in range(1, num_customers + 1):
            if i != j:
                m.addConstr(u[i, k] - u[j, k] + bigM * x[i, j, k] <= bigM - 1)

# Solve model
m.optimize()

# Print solution
if m.status == GRB.OPTIMAL:
    print('Total travel distance: %g' % m.objVal)
    for k in range(num_vehicles):
        print(f"\nVehicle {k+1}'s route:")
        for i in range(num_customers + 1):
            for j in range(num_customers + 1):
                if x[i, j, k].x > 0.5:
                    print(f" From customer {i} to {j}")
```
