Jensen reviewed some of the milestones in NVIDIA's involvement with OpenAI, such as delivering the first GPU to OpenAI, and shared his views on U.S. export controls to China, Huawei, TSMC and chip independence, ASML, and AGI. He also discussed his principles for managing the company and reflected on whether he would still choose to found NVIDIA if he could go back to that morning in 1983.

### Key Discussion Points

1. **U.S. Export Controls to China**  
   Jensen Huang's response was rather diplomatic. As a company, NVIDIA’s goal is business—making money and capturing market share. So when the U.S. imposed restrictions on exports to China, they, as a U.S. company, had to comply with those rules. They adjusted their chip designs according to U.S. regulations and re-entered the market.

   In other interviews, he mentioned that while chip export restrictions to China might be effective in the short term, in the long run, it could spur the development of China's own chip industry. He pointed out that smart people are everywhere, and China has more than 50 companies engaged in chip design. This could potentially allow China to catch up in the chip sector. He estimated that the U.S. is currently 5-10 years ahead of China (though he wasn't certain about the exact figure).

2. **Huawei**  
   He wasn’t particularly surprised by Huawei’s progress, as there had already been market discussions about it. He expressed some skepticism about the rumor that Huawei had achieved a 7nm process from a 16nm shrink. However, he acknowledged that some technology may indeed enable Huawei to produce smartphone chips.

3. **TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company)**  
   Does the U.S. need to be chip-independent? Huang believes this is very difficult because it's a globalized industry chain. Trying to master all the necessary technologies would be extremely challenging. While chip independence is critical to national security and the U.S. wants to lead in cutting-edge technologies, achieving this is a major challenge.

4. **ASML**  
   Is ASML monopolizing the market? Should we be concerned?  
   Huang feels positive about ASML’s role. He acknowledged that ASML has many brilliant people and creates excellent equipment that global companies depend on. However, he sees no need for concern and remains optimistic.

5. **AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)**  
   How many years until AGI is realized?  
   Huang said this depends on how AGI is defined, but he believes it is certainly achievable. If AGI is defined as the ability to perform certain tasks and engage in reasoning, then it could be realized within five years.

6. **Why does Jensen manage 50 direct reports within the company?**  
   The company has a flatter structure. Subordinates don’t need life advice or personal guidance from their leaders.

7. **If time could be reversed, would he still choose to create NVIDIA?**  
   If he had known all the challenges NVIDIA would face in its development, he would not have founded the company. The journey has been too difficult.
