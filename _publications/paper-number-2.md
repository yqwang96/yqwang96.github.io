This study presents a multi-service mode dispatching framework, incorporating a simulator and a two-stage reinforcement learning algorithm, which successfully reduces vehicle idle time and improves passenger experience in ride-sourcing platforms, fulfilling additional basic requests without compromising premium ones, thereby demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of cross-mode dispatching in various scenarios.
