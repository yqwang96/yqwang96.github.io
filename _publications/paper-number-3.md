This research addresses the heterogeneity of passenger cancellation behavior and driver's work patterns in ride-sourcing dispatching problems by utilizing a discrete choice model and Gaussian mixture model, proposing a cooperative deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm for improved dispatching, and implementing a price incentive strategy for enhancing passenger loyalty, resulting in a 2% to 6% improvement in order response rate, a 3% to 9% increase in platform revenue, and a better passenger experience.
