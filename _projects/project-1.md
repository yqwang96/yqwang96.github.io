### Introduction

In the rapid development of modern cities, transportation issues have become a critical factor affecting residents' quality of life and the sustainable growth of urban areas. Precisely predicting demand for shared mobility systems—including ride-hailing services, bike-sharing, and car-sharing—and effectively managing and optimizing these systems have emerged as essential topics in the field of intelligent transportation. This platform leverages advanced predictive algorithms and data visualization technologies to provide shared mobility operators and planners with efficient and comprehensive decision-support tools. Through this system, users can monitor shared mobility traffic in real-time, analyze travel patterns, and develop optimized scheduling strategies and service planning based on prediction results, addressing the growing challenges of shared mobility demand.

### Platform Features

The core functionalities of the platform include:

1. **Travel Demand Prediction**

### Technical Architecture

To ensure efficiency and scalability, the platform adopts a decoupled front-end and back-end architecture:

- **Front-End**: Developed using the React framework, offering a seamless user experience and rich interactive features.
- **Back-End**: Built with Python's Django framework and incorporating various machine learning models for high-accuracy travel demand predictions.
- **Data Storage**: MySQL is chosen as the primary database to flexibly handle the diverse and large-scale data requirements of the transportation domain.

This architectural design ensures the platform performs well when handling complex traffic data while maintaining excellent scalability and maintainability.

### Implementation Details

During development, the platform addressed challenges such as data gaps and the need for high timeliness with innovative solutions:

- Introduced **time-series data analysis models** to enhance the real-time processing and accuracy of data;
- Applied data imputation techniques to address the impact of missing historical data on prediction models;
- Combined regression analysis with neural networks and other algorithms for multi-dimensional model training, further improving prediction accuracy.

These technical measures enable the platform to effectively tackle diverse challenges in real-world transportation scenarios, ensuring the reliability and scientific basis of its predictions.

### Future Outlook

Looking ahead, the platform aims to enhance its capabilities in the following areas:

- **Expansion of Prediction Factors**: Incorporating additional variables such as weather changes and holiday effects to improve the comprehensiveness and accuracy of predictions.
- **Deepening Functional Modules**: Refining existing features and exploring seamless integration with other intelligent transportation systems to create a more robust, unified solution.
- **City Expansion and Scenario Development**: Extending the platform’s reach to more cities and applying it to more complex scenarios such as emergency evacuations and peak holiday traffic management, providing stronger support for smart city development.

Through continuous optimization and technological innovation, we aim to make this platform an essential tool in the field of intelligent transportation, empowering more cities to achieve efficient, intelligent, and sustainable traffic management.
